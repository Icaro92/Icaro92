## Hi there, I'm Icaro 👋

A multidisciplinary professional with a background in Humanities and an expertise in business and data science. 

Early on, I understood that it is essential to approach problems holistically to create real-life solutions to complex problems.
That's why I'm passionate about learning and strive to be a life-long learner.
